How to use:
1.The file "project fig1.nlogo" is for me teach my audience what is T_AS and how it performed. So you can skip it.
2.First run the file "fig1 (modelling of 3 population)" simulate the run in Netlogo. This is the website to download netlogo " https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ ".
3.After it simulate for some time, export data. Your data format should like similar to the file "patch data.txt" on top.
4.After export the data, run it on the file "heatmap2". After running the "heatmap2" in R-program you should get the utilization distribution to show the visit count of vulpes-vulpes within a territory.
5."slide (.key)" file is my slide. There are no detail on it because I prefer clean slide and I prefer explain detail by myself.
