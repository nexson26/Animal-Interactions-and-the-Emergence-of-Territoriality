Tools: R-program and Netlogo

How to use:

The file "project fig1.nlogo" is for me to teach my audience what T_AS is and how it performs. You can skip it.

1. run the file "fig1 (modelling of 3 population)" to simulate the run in NetLogo. This is the website to download NetLogo: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.

2. After it simulates for some time, export the data. Your data format should be similar to the file "patch data.txt" above.

3. After exporting the data, run it in the file "heatmap2". After running "heatmap2" in R, you should get the utilization distribution showing the visit count of Vulpes vulpes within a territory.

4. The "slide (.key)" file is my slide deck. There are no details on it because I prefer clean slides and like to explain the details myself. [(click slide(.key) then click BALME ]
